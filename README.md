Right-click the link above and click "Save linked content as..." and save it to your Desktop.

## How to run

1. Open "installer.bat" (if you want to install MultiMC in a protected folder E.g.: "C:\Program Files (x86)" then you need to run the .bat as Administrator)
2. Enter the installation path (E.g.: "C:\Program Files" and it will create a MultiMC folder in that directory, that means the location of the .exe would be: "C:\Program Files (x86)\MultiMC\MultiMC.exe")
3. MultiMC is now installed and a shortcut was made in your start menu and in the directory you ran the .bat, after you restarted your PC you can search for MultiMC in your Taskbar search
